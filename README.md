## Introduction
Biometric scanners, such as face or finger-print recognition, have become increasingly
less secure. With these technologies struggling to maintain the needed amount of security
people desire, new biometric technologies are needed. EEG recognition is much harder to fake,
which is why it could be used for secure biometric identification. 

## Goal
Our primary target contribution is to develop image classification models to accurately classify EEG signals. Second, we would
like to evaluate the efficacy of our model by testing it on a dataset of 105 individuals. 

## Results
We successfully built a logistic regression model to perform classification at an accuracy of 78%.
Additionally, we were able to create a Feed Forward Network to classify at an even higher
accuracy of 94%. More interestingly, we find that CNNs struggle to perform this classification
with an accuracy of only 71%.

# Notes
This project was developed for CIS519: Applied Machine Learning with contributors Harsha Santhanam and Sandhya Bellary. Our project mentor was Ricardo. I primarily worked on data extraction, data cleaning, Feed Forward Network and the Convolutional Neural Network.
